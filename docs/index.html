    <h1 style="align-self: center;">krnl; a bare bones x86 compatible kernel </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>krnl: this marks the beginning of the development of krnl.
        i wish to learn about working with the bare metal hardware to create a kernel capable
        of booting into the system and work further from there. this is NOT a project that aims
        to solve a problem, rather it aims to mark my personal interest in low level program development
        and is NOT fit for production use.

    <hr>
        what krnl is capable of:
            <ul>
                <li>booting into system main memory using GNU GRUB as the bootloader</li>
                <li>start an init process which will load all the drivers</li>
                <li>loading drivers for a keyboard, a mouse to allow for input</li>
                <li>capable of mounting memory as a file system, and allowing for temporary storage of any data</li>
                <li>further capabilities will be added .....</li>
            </ul>
            
        what krnl will NOT be capable of:
            <ul>
                <li>having a rendering library that allows for graphics to work</li>
                <li>network capabilities</li>
                <li>this list will also be extended as development goes on</li>
            </ul>
